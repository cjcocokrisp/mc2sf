## mc2sf

mc2sf is a backup tool for Minecraft servers. It is meant to backup servers and then upload those backups to
[Seafile](https://www.seafile.com/en/home/), a self hosted file sync and share software. Right now this is a really
basic implementation for the time being. This README will be updated when I add more to this.

### How to Use

Under construction!

### Future Features

Right now this is just a really basic implementation. I want add the following in the future.

- More options like server name and such

- More pretty Discord webhook message (With embeds)

- Ability to back up multiple servers

- More detailed logging

- CLI arguments so its more then just for K8S
